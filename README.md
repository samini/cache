Both the actual framework and the sample Cache-enhanced app are Android projects. They can be setup and built most easily using ADT:
http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

Since the framework uses an aidl to auto-generate the Android service Java code, it is recommended to use a bundled version of ADT rather than the ADT plugin for eclipse. The ADT eclipse plugin sometimes has issues auto-generating code from aidl.

Notes for users:

* Framework Updates:

The framework uses Google's Geocoding API. For more information on the API, refer to:
http://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/

For the framework, CacheServiceV1/src/edu/cmu/ece/cache/framework/location/geocode/GeoCode.java needs to be updated to conform with Google's latest Geocoding API.

* Sample App Updates:

The sample app uses the Yelp developer API. For more information on the API and API id, refer to:
http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/technical_overview

For the sample application, please provide a Google Maps API key in the following file:
CacheYelpAppV1/res/layout/yelp_map_activity.xml

The YELP API id should be updated in the following files (Look for FIXMEs):
CacheYelpAppV1/src/edu/cmu/ece/cache/sample/yelp/Main.java
CacheYelpAppV1/src/edu/cmu/ece/cache/sample/yelp/YelpContentRequest.java
